	abstract = {The basis for central bank policy aimed at price stability is the view that the benefits from very low inflation are "large and permanent," and that the related unemployment costs are "small and temporary." I question this belief in three ways: first, I point out that the quantitative evidence of large direct macroeconomic benefits from very low inflation is flimsy. Second, I show that the traditional inflation-unemployment trade-off, which leaves no room for a permanent effect of monetary policy on output and employment, is a total failure as a description of the Canadian experience of the past decade. Third, I report on new evidence which shows that holding inflation below 2 percent (as the Bank of Canada has done since 1991) increases unemployment substantially and permanently, but that pushing inflation above 4 percent also generates higher permanent unemployment. Consequently, the optimal, unemployment-minimizing rate of inflation would be neither less than 2 percent nor greater than 4 percent, but would lie somewhere in between. I conclude that what is called for at this time is a monetary policy that is opportunistic on the expansionary side and brings the inflation rate into this range. Since poverty and unemployment are highly correlated, this new approach could also reduce poverty in Canada.},

For example, we nd that households who stand to lose from an interest rate hike are signicantly more sensitive to income shocks than those who stand to gain. Following a one percentage point rate increase, we estimate consumption will decrease by 26 basis points through this interest rate exposure channel alone, making this channel substantially larger than the intertemporal substitution channel that is the key mechanism in representative agent New Keynesian models.},

A dynamic panel model using the Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) estimator was used to control for both individual and time-specific effects. The Heterogeneous aspect of the Augmented Dicky-Fuller (ADF), the Levine-Lin-Chu test and, the Im-Pesaran-Shin (IPS) panel units root process were utilized to test for the stationarity of the panel data. The results of the General Method of Moment (GMM) indicate a significant negative relationship between income inequality and economic growth. The study rejected the existence of the Kuznets curve hypothesis, and concludes that Inflation rate, Wage rate and labour force impact negatively income inequality, while unemployment and education impact positively.},

We find that these effects are heterogenous across countries and channels. While expansionary monetary policy reduces inequality in three core EMU economies (France, Belgium, the Netherlands), Spain and Portu-gal, it increases inequality in Germany, Austria, Finland, and Italy, and has no impact in Greece. The strong evidence is found for the credit channel, as credit growth reacts to a monetary policy shock and influences income distribution. Loose monetary policy reduces income inequality by boosting house and stock prices growth when the real estate and equity ownership is distributed broadly across the population , but raises inequality when the ownership is concentrated among high-income households. The macroeconomic channel and fiscal redistribution matter, too.},

A central feature is that matching frictions render labor-market risk countercyclical and endogenous to monetary policy. Our main result is that a majority of households prefer substantial stabilization of unemployment even if this means deviations from price stability. A monetary policy focused on unemployment stabilization helps "Main Street" by providing consumption insurance. It hurts "Wall Street" by reducing precautionary saving and, thus, asset prices.

@article{Kuznets1955,
	abstract = {Most debate on the internal gap between rich and poor people in developing nations begins with this seminal presidential address delivered by Simon Kuznets to the American Economic Association in 1954. The address, portions of which are reprinted here, uses limited data from Germany; the United Kingdom, and the United States to draw the conclusion that since the 1920s, and perhaps even earlier; there has been a trend toward equalization in the distribution of income. Kuznets discusses in some detail the possible causes for this trend, examining those factors in the process of industrialization that tend to counteract the trend toward the increasing concentration of savings in the hands of the wealthy. That particular discussion is not in the portions of the address included here, but the interested reader can consult the original piece (see citation at the bottom of this page). Our interest lies in Kuznets's conclusion that the central factor in equalizing income must have been the rising incomes of the poorer sectors outside of the traditional agricultural economy. The critically important notion of the “inverted U curve” although not labeled as such in the address, is introduced in Kuznets's argument that there seems to be a trend of increasing inequality in the early phases of industrialization, followed by declines in the later phases only. Finally, Kuznets opens the debate over the relevance of these findings for the developing nations by examining data from India, Ceylon (today, Sri Lanka), and Puerto Rico. The findings that income inequality in the developing countries is greater than that in the advanced countries, and that such inequality may be growing even greater, form the basis of virtually all subsequent research and debate on this subject.},

This was followed by a decrease in overall spending of 25%–30% during the second half of March coinciding with the disease spreading, with only food delivery and grocery spending as major exceptions to the decline. Spending responded most strongly in states with active shelter-in-place orders, though individuals in all states had sizable responses.

We analyze this question using a calibrated version of the stochastic growth model with partially uninsurable idiosyncratic risk and movements in aggregate productivity. Our main finding is that, in the stationary stochastic equilibrium, the behavior of the macroeconomic aggregates can be almost perfectly described using only the mean of the wealth distribution. This result is robust to substantial changes in both parameter values and model specification. Our benchmark model, whose only difference from the representative-agent framework is the existence of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, displays far less cross-sectional dispersion and skewness in wealth than U.S. data. However, an extension that relies on a small amount of heterogeneity in thrift does succeed in replicating the key features of the wealth data.

In contrast to earlier papers, we insist on at least roughly matching the model's implications for heterogeneity - notably, the equilibrium distributions of income and wealth-with those in U.S. data. This approach seems natural: Models that rely critically on heterogeneity for explaining asset prices are not convincing unless the heterogeneity is quantitatively reasonable. We find that the class of models we consider here is very far from success in explaining the equity premium when parameters are restricted to produce reasonable equilibrium heterogeneity. We express the equity premium as a product of two factors: the standard deviation of the excess return and the market price of risk. The first factor, as expected, is much too low in the model. The size of the market price of risk depends crucially on the constraints on borrowing. If substantial borrowing is allowed, the market price of risk is about one one-hundredth of what it is in the data (and about 15% higher than in the representative-agent model). However, under the most severe borrowing constraints that we consider, the market price of risk is quite close to the observed value.},

Using municipality-level income and mortality data, we show that the stark income gradient in infant mortality across municipalities in the 1950s mostly closed in the late 1960s. However, the income gradient in mortality for older age categories across municipalities persisted until 2010 and only flattened thereafter. Further, the infant mortality gap between rich and poor Norwegian families based on individual-level data persisted several decades longer than the gap between rich and poor municipalities and only finally closed in the early 21st century.},

The empirical results present that there are positive effects (expected) of the expected rate of depreciation in market exchange rates on the holdings of US dollars. The coefficients are statistically significant only for Cambodia and Laos, not for Vietnam.

	abstract = {This thesis studies the link between monetary policy and inequality in the United States. In a first, empirical part of the thesis, I provide some evidence regarding the distributive consequences of monetary policy shocks during the Great Moderation period from a structural VAR. I find that contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to a significant increase in consumption inequality. Furthermore, monetary policy shocks explain a non-negligible part of the variations in inequality at business cycle frequencies. In the second, theoretical part, I propose a DSGE model that can account for these findings. The model is a variant of the New Keynesian model featuring substantial but limited heterogeneity on the part of the households. The tractability of the framework allows me to estimate the model based on data for the United States. The conjectured limited heterogeneity equilibrium turns out to be consistent with the data and the estimated model is able to match the evolution of economic inequality in the data remarkably well. Most importantly, its predictions regarding the redistributive effects of monetary policy shocks are qualitatively in line with the empirical evidence: contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to an increase in consumption inequality and explain non-negligible fractions of its variance. Sensitivity analyses suggest that these findings are extraordinarily robust along a number of dimensions and can in principle be even more pronounced. In particular, the redistributive effects get stronger when the central bank is more dovish, when the degree of nominal rigidities increases, or when the borrowing limit is less restrictive. i},

Moreover, this paper also employs the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) which shows the relationship between exchange rate and inflation. The empirical results reveal that money supply in Cambodia, depends on its previous variable. Moreover, money supply also induces the depreciation of exchange rate of Khmer Riel against US Dollar and leads to increase in inflation. Money supply induces 8% of shock to exchange rate and 0.13% to inflation based on variance decomposition while exchange rate can cause 0.024% to inflation in Cambodia. The relative low shocks from money supply to inflation and exchange rate results in supplying money with cautious manner from National Bank of Cambodia.

I build a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model with household portfolio choice, wage and price rigidities, endogenous unemployment, frictional financial intermediation, an effective lower bound (ELB) on the policy rate, forward guidance, and QE. To quantify the contribution of the various channels through which monetary policy affects inequality, I estimate the model using Bayesian methods, explicitly taking into account the occasionally binding ELB constraint and the QE operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve during the 2009-2015 period. I find that QE program unambiguously benefited all households by stimulating economic activity. However, it had non-linear distributional effects. On the one hand, it widened the income and consumption gap between the top 10% and the rest of the wealth distribution, by boosting profits and equity prices. On the other hand, QE shrank inequality within the lower 90% of the wealth distribution, primarily by lowering unemployment. On net, it reduced overall wealth and income inequality, as measured by the Gini index. Surprisingly, QE has weaker distributional consequences compared with conventional monetary policy. Lastly, forward guidance and an extended period of zero policy rates amplified both the aggregate and the distributional effects of QE.},

@article{Martin2020,
	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive economic shock across the world due to business interruptions and shutdowns from social-distancing measures. To evaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, a micro-economic model is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household income, savings, consumption, and poverty. The model assumes two periods: a crisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can use their precautionary savings to maintain consumption; and a recovery period, when households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level. The San Francisco Bay Area is used as a case study, and the impacts of a lockdown are quantified, accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance (UI) and the CARES Act federal stimulus. Assuming a shelter-in-place period of three months, the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 17.1% to 25.9% in the Bay Area in the absence of social protection, and the lowest income earners would suffer the most in relative terms. If fully implemented, the combination of UI and CARES could keep the increase in poverty close to zero, and reduce the average recovery time, for individuals who suffer an income loss, from 11.8 to 6.7 months. However, the severity of the economic impact is spatially heterogeneous, and certain communities are more affected than the average and could take more than a year to recover. Overall, this model is a first step in quantifying the household-level impacts of COVID-19 at a regional scale. This study can be extended to explore the impact of indirect macroeconomic effects, the role of uncertainty in households' decision-making and the potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks (e.g., natural disasters).},

	abstract = {How does income inequality and its structure affect credit? Based on various strands of the literature, we hypothesize that rising income inequality should lead to higher household credit at the aggregate level, and that a substantial part of this effect should be driven by the impoverishment of the middle class relative to top-income households. These intuitions are empirically confirmed by a study based on a country-level dataset over the period 1970–2017. To identify exogenous variations in inequality, we develop an instrumental variable approach based on two types of country-level instruments: the total number of ratified ILO conventions and factor endowments. Our results show exogenous variations in inequality have a positive impact on household credit: a one-standard-deviation increase in the Gini index generates a 5- to 8- percentage-point expansion in the ratio of household credit to GDP. In addition, the impact is 1.5–1.8 times stronger when the increase in inequality is driven by the income of top earners relative to the middle class rather than by the increase in top earners' incomes at the expense of the lowest percentiles of the distribution. Those results are robust to various sets of instruments, databases, controls, and variable definitions. They also consistently disappear in countries where financial markets are insufficiently developed.},

	How does income inequality and it structure affect credit? 
	
	Method
	OLS estimator
	
	Sample 
	A country-level yearly dataset for 30 developed countries over the period 1979-2017. Household credit over GDP dataset comes from the Bank of International Settlements, and income dataset comes from the World Income Inequality Database. 
	
	Our Critical Response 
	Our working paper should discuss about general context of households income sources by specific countries and regions. It's a part of literature session. For example, the increase of income and credit among housholds in eash regions or countries.
	
	Results
	The correlation between inequality and credit is massively insignificant in all specifications.
	
	This paper shows that rises in various indicators of income inequality driven by different exogenous sources trigger expansions of household credit, and that this effect is substantially higher when top incomes grow richer at the expense of middle classes, rather than at the expense of low incomes.
	
	Should read Kumhof et al. (2015), who applied a DSGE model to relying on inequalities between two household groups, means that top and bottom earners.

This study employs the data in the period of 2000-2018 consisting in total 19 years. Once the GDP of Cambodia is characterized as the limited dependent variable, the Tobit model is an appropriate model to be used. However, due to the limited data which only consists of 19 observations, this study uses Bayesian inference. The combination between Tobit model and Bayesian inference is known as Bayesian Tobit Model. The Bayesian Tobit Model with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation uses Gibbs sampling to sample all conditional posterior distributions. The empirical results illustrate that money supply which represents the monetary policy tool is statistically indicated a positive correlation with GDP in Cambodia. Moreover, the inflation rate and exchange also revealed a positive relationship with GDP. The interest rate, on the other hand, is confirmed negatively insignificant with GDP which represents economic growth in Cambodia. Based on statistical results, the National Bank of Cambodia plays a vital role in authorizing the monetary policy in Cambodia.},

While low interest rates and rising bond prices have had a negligible impact on wealth inequality, rising equity prices have been a key driver of inequality.

To understand how these return differences shape the distribution of wealth, I introduce realistic return heterogeneity in a partial equilibrium model of household saving behavior.

Using a measure of unanticipated changes in policy rates for a panel of 32 advanced and emerging market countries over the period 1990-2013, the paper finds that contractionary (expansionary) monetary actions increase (reduce) income inequality. The effect, however, varies over time, depending on the type of the shocks (tightening versus expansionary monetary policy) and the state of the business cycle, and across countries depending on the share of labor income and redistribution policies. In particular, we find that the effect is larger for positive monetary policy shocks, especially during expansions. Looking across countries, we find that the effect is larger in countries with higher labor share of income and smaller redistribution policies.

The study includes four countries that had income inequality data covering that period. Using panel data methods – Fixed Effects and Augmented Mean Group estimators – we found a significant effect of these pandemics on declining income inequality. The study argues that based on the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic, namely that fatalities are highly concentrated in older age groups, we can neither expect a labor scarcity nor a sharp decline in productivity; however, we could expect a reduction in consumption, the possibility of savings, high unemployment rates, and high public debt ratios. The ultimate effects of COVID-19 on inequality remain unclear so far, as some of its inherent characteristics push for an increase in inequality. In contrast, others push toward a narrowing of the income gap.},

We use detailed micro level information to construct quarterly historical measures of inequality from 1969 to 2012. We investigate whether monetary policy shocks played a role in explaining this increase in inequality. We find that contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to an increase in earnings, income and consumption inequality and contribute to their fluctuation. The response of income and consumption at different quantiles suggests that contractionary policy has a larger negative effect on low income households and those that consume the least when compared to those at the top of the distribution. Our evidence also suggests that the policy of quantitative easing may have contributed to the increase in inequality over the Great Recession.},

Though formulated as a precautionary-saving model {\`{a}} la Huggett–Aiyagari, its reduced form is a two-agent model with a highly concentrated wealth distribution. When prices are sticky and wages flexible, as in the textbook representative-agent model, monetary policy affects the distribution of consumption, but has no effect on output as workers choose not to change their hours worked in response to wage movements. This highlights a transmission mechanism of the textbook model that we find implausible: in response to a monetary stimulus, the representative worker's labor supply is greatly affected by the profits she receives. First, the lower profits induced by higher wages raise labor supply through a wealth effect and, secondly, the mere presence of profits reduces the negative income effect of a wage rise. When wages are rigid, in contrast, our model exhibits plausible responses of output and hours worked to monetary policy shocks.},

Uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and future contagion waves even led companies to view WFH as a ‘new normal' way of working. Based on influence function regression methods, this paper explores the potential consequences in the labour income distribution related to a long-lasting increase in WFH feasibility among Italian employees. Results show that a positive shift in WFH feasibility would be associated with an increase in average labour income, but this potential benefit would not be equally distributed among employees. Specifically, an increase in the opportunity to WFH would favour male, older, high-educated, and high-paid employees. However, this ‘forced innovation' would benefit more employees living in provinces have been more affected by the novel coronavirus. WFH thus risks exacerbating pre-existing inequalities in the labour market, especially if it will not be adequately regulated. As a consequence, this study suggests that policies aimed at alleviating inequality, like income support measures (in the short run) and human capital interventions (in the long run), should play a more important compensating role in the future.},

@article{Mundell1963,
	abstract = {THE world is still a closed economy, but its regions and countries are becoming increasingly open. The trend, which has been manifested in both freer move-ment of goods and increased mobility of capital, has been stimulated by the dismantling of trade and exchange controls in Europe, the gradual erosion of the real burden of tariff protection, and the stability, unparalleled since 1914, of the exchange rates. The international economic climate has changed in the direction of financial integration' and this has important implications for economic policy. My paper concerns the theoretical and practical implications of the increased mobility of capital. In order to present my conclusions in the simplest possible way, and to bring the implications for policy into sharpest relief, I assume the extreme degree of mobility that prevails when a country cannot maintain an interest rate different from the general level prevailing abroad. This assump-tion will overstate the case but it has the merit of posing a stereotype towards which international financial relations seem to be heading. At the same time it might be argued that the assumption is not far from the truth in those financial centres, of which Zurich, Amsterdam, and Brussels may be taken as examples, where the authorities already recognize their lessening ability to dominate money market conditions and insulate them from foreign influ-ences. It should also have a high degree of relevance to a country like Canada whose financial markets are dominated to a great degree by the vast New York market. I. METHOD OF ANALYSIS},

In this paper it is shown that the expansionary effect of a given increase in money supply will always be greater if the country has a floating exchange rate than if it has a fixed rate. By contrast, it is uncertain whether the expansionary effect on the demand for domestic output of a given increase in budgetary expenditure or a given reduction in tax rates will be larger or smaller with a floating than with a fixed rate. In all but extreme cases, the stimulus to monetary demand arising from an increase in money supply will be greater, relative to that arising from an expansionary change in budgetary policy, with a floating than with a fixed rate of exchange.},

@article{Deininger1996,
	abstract = {In the past two decades, in a series of banking crises around the world, banks have become systematically insolvent. These crises have occured in developed and developing economies alike. To make such financial system breakdowns less likely and to limit their costs if they occur, policymakers feel the need for financial safety nets. These include such policies as implicit or explicit deposit insurance, a lender of last resort function of the central bank, bank insolvency resolution procedures, and bank regulation and supervision. Of these policies, explicit deposit insurance has been gaining popularity in recent years. Since the 1980s the number of countries with explicit deposit insurance schemes almost tripled, with most OECD countries and an increasing number of developing economies adopting some form of explicit depositor protection. In 1994 deposit insurance became the standard for the newly created single banking market of the European Union. Establishing an explicit deposit insurance scheme became part of the generally accepted best practice advice given to developing economies.},

@article{Han2020,
	abstract = {This paper addresses the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing timely and accurate information on the impact of the current pandemic on income and poverty to inform the targeting of resources to those most affected and assess the success of current efforts. We construct new measures of the income distribution and poverty with a lag of only a few weeks using high-frequency data from the Basic Monthly Current Population Survey (CPS), which collects income information for a large, representative sample of US families. Because the family income data for this project are rarely used, we validate this timely measure of income by comparing historical estimates that rely on these data to estimates from data on income and consumption that have been used much more broadly. Our results indicate that at the start of the pandemic, government policy effectively countered its effects on incomes, leading poverty to fall and low percentiles of income to rise across a range of demographic groups and geographies. Simulations that rely on the detailed CPS data and that closely match total government payments made show that the entire decline in poverty that we find can be accounted for by the rise in government assistance, including unemployment insurance benefits and the Economic Impact Payments. Our simulations further indicate that of those losing employment the vast majority received unemployment insurance,though this was less true early on in the pandemic, and receipt was uneven across the states, with some states not reaching a large share of their out of work residents. Updated results during the pandemic for a subset of the tables in this article can be found at povertymeasurement.org.},

The main conclusion is that the decline in income inequality that took place during the first half of the century was mostly accidental. In France, and possibly in a number of other countries as well, wage inequality has been extremely stable in the long run, and the secular decline in income inequality is for the most part a capital income phenomenon. Holders of large fortunes were badly hurt by major shocks during the 1914-45 period, and they were never able to fully recover from these shocks, probably because of the dynamic effects of progressive taxation on capital accumulation and pretax income inequality.},

It is estimated that the gain from reducing the annual inflation rate from 10 percent to zero is equivalent to an increase in real income of slightly less than one percent. Using aggregate evidence only, it may not be possible to estimate reliably the gains from reducing inflation further, to a rate consistent with zero nominal interest.},

Our main results are: (i) a contractionary interest rate shock increases inequality, while inflation and the output gap fall; (ii) the welfare-based objective of monetary policy includes inequality stabilization; (iii) as the proportion of unskilled agents increases, welfare decreases; and (iv) under scarcity of skilled agents, monetary policy is weakened, while fiscal policy produces a more relevant impact on the economy.},
